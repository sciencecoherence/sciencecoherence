## Purpose
Seed document for the **Regenesis** thread (biology, nutrition, protocols). This sets the scope and how we keep claims evidence-linked.

## Core framing (working)
Treat the body and mind as a **biological computer**:
- Body = “hardware” (organs, tissues, metabolism, repair systems)
- Mind = “software” (cognition, perception, behavior loops)
Goal: improve regeneration by optimizing inputs, cycles, and constraints (sleep, nutrition, light, stress, training).

> Safety note: This thread must avoid medical claims without citations. No diagnosis/treatment promises. Protocols should be presented as educational + evidence-linked.

## Primary Regenesis priorities
1) **Sleep quality & regeneration**
   - mechanisms: circadian rhythm, growth hormone pulses, glymphatic clearance, synaptic homeostasis, immune modulation
2) **Tissue repair & longevity pathways**
   - protein turnover, autophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis, inflammation resolution
3) **Nutrition as signal environment**
   - macronutrient timing, micronutrient sufficiency, gut barrier integrity, metabolic flexibility

## Claims: facts vs hypotheses
### Facts (must cite in public digests)
- Sleep loss impairs metabolic health, immune function, and cognitive performance (many sources).
- Circadian rhythm misalignment affects hormone signaling and metabolism.
- Protein and energy balance influence tissue repair.

### Hypotheses / personal claims (must remain labeled until validated)
- Specific diet assertions (e.g., “raw meat only is optimal”) require extremely careful treatment:
  - strong claims need strong evidence
  - safety considerations (pathogens, nutrient balance) must be addressed
- Any supplement protocol claims must be evidence-linked and cautious.

## Protocol philosophy (how we publish)
Protocols should be written as:
- “What the evidence suggests”
- “What is plausible but unproven”
- “What to monitor (signals/metrics)”
- “Risks/contraindications”
- “How to iterate safely”

## Suggested Regenesis digest categories
- Sleep optimization (light, timing, temperature, routines)
- Regeneration biology (autophagy, inflammation, repair)
- Nutrition biology (gut barrier, micronutrients, protein quality)
- Protocol stacks (only if each component has citations + safety notes)

## Metrics and signals (non-medical)
- sleep duration and consistency
- subjective sleep quality
- resting heart rate / HRV trends (if available)
- energy levels, cognition, mood stability
- digestion tolerance
- training recovery markers

## Publishing standard (Regenesis)
Each digest must include:
- Summary
- Key findings (bullets)
- Evidence & citations
- Hypotheses section (clearly labeled)
- Risks / safety notes
- Next queries

## First Regenesis mission (suggested)
“Sleep and regeneration: what reliably improves repair and recovery?”
- prioritize high-quality reviews / primary studies
- produce a short actionable checklist with citations
- explicitly label anything speculative
