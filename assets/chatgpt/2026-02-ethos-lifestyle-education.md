## Purpose
Seed document for the **Ethos** thread (lifestyle, education, culture, practice).  
Ethos is where we translate research into *how to live, learn, build, and teach* without turning into ideology.

## Core framing (working)
Ethos = the human-facing layer:
- how we interpret evidence
- how we make decisions under uncertainty
- how we teach and communicate
- how we build habits, rituals, and systems that stay aligned with reality

This is not “motivational content.” It is an applied epistemology + education + lifestyle engineering layer.

## Scope
### In scope
- Research literacy: how to read papers, avoid misinformation, and form robust beliefs
- Education modules: explainers for concepts (from beginner to advanced)
- Lifestyle protocols (non-medical): sleep hygiene basics, focus systems, learning practice, environment design
- Community norms: open science principles, citation discipline, humility, correction loops
- Ethics: responsible publishing, harm minimization, transparency in uncertainty

### Out of scope (unless explicitly requested)
- Partisan politics
- Medical diagnosis/treatment claims (belongs in Regenesis with strict citations + safety framing)
- Conspiracy framing or adversarial rhetoric
- Personal/private data

## Publishing modes (must be explicit)
- **Hypothesis**: exploratory, uncertain, test-in-progress.
- **Practice Note**: a lifestyle/learning practice with rationale + limits.
- **Education Module**: structured teaching content, progressive difficulty.
- **Ready for Main**: validated, stable, fits Science Coherence main site.

## “Facts vs Hypotheses” rule
- If a claim is factual or scientific: include a citation link.
- If not supported: label **Hypothesis**.
- If a claim is guidance-oriented: clarify context, tradeoffs, and who it may not apply to.

## Ethos pillars (themes to build around)
1) **Epistemic hygiene**
   - how to avoid being fooled
   - how to update beliefs
   - how to separate signal from noise
2) **Learning as a system**
   - spaced repetition, retrieval practice, interleaving
   - building mental models
   - teaching as compression
3) **Attention & environment**
   - focus practices, deep work routines
   - digital minimalism (non-dogmatic)
   - designing spaces for cognition
4) **Agency & iteration**
   - small experiments, feedback loops
   - journaling as instrumentation
   - “protocols” for habits with measurable outcomes
5) **Ethics of publishing**
   - cite sources, mark uncertainty
   - avoid medical promises
   - minimize harm and hype

## Output types (what Ethos should publish)
### A) Education modules
Short pages that teach one concept clearly:
- “How to read an abstract”
- “What is a control group”
- “Correlation vs causation”
- “How to evaluate evidence quality”

### B) Practice notes
Concrete routines with constraints:
- “Daily research ritual (30 minutes)”
- “Weekly synthesis workflow”
- “How to build a personal glossary”

### C) Tooling guides
How to use the Cohera pipeline responsibly:
- “How digests are generated”
- “What citations mean here”
- “How to challenge a digest”

## Minimal standard for every Ethos post
- Summary (what it is)
- Why it matters
- Steps / structure (if applicable)
- Limits & failure modes
- Citations (if making factual claims)
- Next iteration idea

## First Ethos missions (suggested)
1) **Research literacy quickstart**
   - A 1-page guide: how to read papers + common traps
2) **Uncertainty labeling**
   - A standard “Confidence + Hypothesis” rubric used across all threads
3) **Education pathway**
   - A simple curriculum map:
     - Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced for Cosmos/Regenesis concepts

## Notes for Cohera
Ethos should feel:
- calm, clear, and pragmatic
- anti-hype
- “show your work”
- aligned with Science Coherence’s tone and long-term credibility
