# 2026-02-physics-model-foundation.md

## Purpose
Seed document for the **Cosmos** thread (physics/math). Captures the foundational model direction, vocabulary, and a verification-first research agenda.

## Core framing (working)
We model reality as an informational substrate whose dynamics generate emergent spacetime, matter, observers, and consistent “laws” as higher-level invariants.

### Minimal chain (current working loop)
**H_tot → S → Λ → Ω → Δ → H_tot**

- **H_tot**: total constraint/dynamics layer (global generator/selector)
- **S**: substrate (informational base; rule-space / configuration space)
- **Λ**: coherence / projection / selection operator (restricts allowed patterns)
- **Ω**: emergent universe layer (effective world, “what shows up”)
- **Δ**: recursive self-modeling / integration operator (feedback, refinement)

> Status: *Conceptual scaffold.* Needs formalization into mathematically precise objects and conditions (operator domains, topology/measure, update rule).

## Key goals
1. Define a **minimal mathematical architecture** that is coherent, testable, and not overloaded.
2. Derive **known effective physics** as limiting behavior:
   - thermodynamic / hydrodynamic limits
   - effective metric dynamics (GR-like behavior)
   - weak-field Newtonian limit
   - boundedness / absence of singularities via finite coherence bounds
3. Articulate the “holographic/time-crystalline” aspects as **derivable properties**, not vibes.

## Definitions to stabilize (must become explicit)
- Substrate state/configuration: Ψ (or equivalent)
- Coherence functional: C[Ψ] (define what it measures)
- Free-energy / informational drive: F_sub[Ψ] or equivalent (define sign conventions)
- Invariant set / attractor: I (what defines the emergent “world”)
- Update rule: U or Φ (Floquet-like or discrete-time map), if used

> Rule: avoid extra operators unless they do real work.

## Claims: facts vs hypotheses
### Facts (should be backed by citations once we publish)
- “Floquet dynamics” describes periodic driving where an effective evolution operator over one period is used.
- Holographic principles relate bulk/boundary information scaling in certain theories.
- Time crystals: periodic structure in time (discrete time translation symmetry breaking), with strict constraints on equilibrium vs driven systems.

### Hypotheses (must be clearly labeled until supported)
- The substrate admits a stable time-crystalline update rule underlying emergent temporality.
- Λ acts as a selection operator producing classicality-like stability and low-dimensional effective dynamics.
- Entropy–curvature dualities emerge from coherence geometry.
- Finite coherence bounds prevent curvature singularities.

## Research agenda (Cosmos thread)
### A. Formalization tasks
- Specify the substrate space: Hilbert space? measure space? operator algebra? category-theoretic structure?
- Define Λ precisely: projection? CPTP map? coarse-graining? constraint operator?
- Define Δ precisely: recursion, inference, renormalization, integration of self-model?

### B. “Time-crystalline” angle (verification-first)
- Collect primary sources on:
  - discrete time crystals (Floquet time crystals)
  - no-go theorems (equilibrium time crystals)
  - experimental realizations
- Extract what’s required: driving, locality, many-body interactions, disorder, prethermal regimes.

### C. “Holographic” angle (verification-first)
- Collect primary sources on:
  - holographic entropy bounds
  - AdS/CFT basics (only as needed)
  - entanglement ↔ geometry (Ryu–Takayanagi and descendants)
- Identify what is essential vs what is optional for our framework.

### D. Quantum information angle
- Use quantum info language where it clarifies:
  - error correction / redundancy
  - entanglement structure
  - coarse-graining / emergent classicality
- Avoid importing jargon without function.

## Publishing standard (for Cohera)
Every Cosmos digest must include:
- 5–10 bullet “Key findings”
- citations for each nontrivial claim (prefer arXiv + journal + lecture notes)
- explicit “Hypotheses” section
- “Next queries” section (what to search next)

## Next steps (initial)
- Build the first Cosmos digest: “Time crystals + holography + quantum information: minimal common ground”
- From that digest, propose the minimal set of operators/structures we truly need.
