            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: white;">
                This framework uses a minimal, fixed set of primitives. They are not layers of reality, but roles inside
                a single closed loop. S is the only fundamental domain; the others are roles that transform, restrict,
                summarize, and close the evolution of S.

                <p>An architecture is defined by causal ordering and interface contracts. To keep the framework
                    coherent, we
                    enforce strict boundaries on what each role is allowed to do and what it is forbidden from
                    introducing.

                <h3>WHAT "WORLD" MEANS HERE</h3>
                <p>
                    A "world" is not a container. It is a stable presentation of the substrate under accessibility
                    constraints.
                </p>
                <ul style="margin-top: 15px; color: #ccc; line-height: 1.6;">
                    <li>The substrate S is the only fundamental domain.</li>
                    <li>A presented world is what remains stable under Λ, and therefore can behave as localized
                        structure.
                    </li>
                    <li>The apparent world-rule is the induced summary of that stable presentation.</li>

                <p style="margin-top: 15px; border-left: 3px solid var(--accent); padding-left: 15px; color: white;">
                    The punchline is brutally simple: the world is what the architecture can keep presenting coherently,
                    cycle after cycle.

                <h3>NOT A DECORATIVE LAYER</h3>
                <p>
                    Many frameworks make emergence cosmetic: the substrate produces appearances, but the appearances do
                    not
                    matter. This architecture rejects that. If stable patterns appear at the emergent level and never
                    influence future global evolution, the world is an illusion with no causal teeth.

            <p style="line-height: 1.8; color: #ddd;">
                You should now be able to visualize reality as a closed five-role loop. S is the only fundamental
                domain. Htot transforms S coherently. Λ restricts what can be stably presented as local persistence.
                Ω
                describes the stable presented regime as an induced effective world-rule. Δ integrates stable
                emergent
                structure back into the next conditions, enforcing closure. This is not extra ontology or observer
                magic—just a closed generative blueprint that continuously produces and stabilizes a world-like
                presentation.
