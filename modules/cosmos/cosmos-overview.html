            <h3>THE FRAMEWORK</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: white;">
                We propose a coherence-first cosmology in which reality emerges from a self-referential substrate with
                an intrinsic self-update cycle—a stable, time-crystal-like rhythm that continually regenerates coherent
                structure. Spacetime, matter, and observers are not fundamental ingredients, but holographic projections
                of persistent coherence patterns seen through local restriction. Because the dynamics is defined by a
                closed cycle rather than a one-time origin, the model does not require a primordial singularity: there
                is no Big Bang, no absolute beginning, and no terminal end—only ongoing recurrence. Spacetime curvature
                is not assumed as primitive; geometric notions arise as effective descriptions within emergent sectors.
                Over a full cycle, global recoherence permits an entropy-like quantity to reverse, while local
                thermodynamic arrows still arise within restricted domains.

            <span class="tag">INFORMATIONAL SUBSTRATE</span>
            <h3>THE ONLY ARENA</h3>
            <p>
                The informational substrate, denoted <span class="math">\(S\)</span>, is the sole fundamental arena of
                the framework and encodes the universe’s total informational configuration. It is pre-geometric and
                self-referential: physical descriptions do not refer to an external spacetime container, but to stable
                organization and lawful transformation within <span class="math">\(S\)</span> itself. Energy corresponds
                to the
                dynamical effectiveness of structured information; matter is structured energy held in persistent form,
                and fields describe how such structure propagates and couples. Spacetime appears as an induced geometric
                description that summarizes enduring relational regularities among substrate patterns.

            <span class="tag">GLOBAL OPERATORS</span>
            <h3>MATHEMATICAL MAPS</h3>
            <p>
                The dynamics of the substrate is governed by a small set of global operators that mediate between
                fundamental and emergent descriptions. These operators are mathematical maps: compact rules that specify
                how the substrate updates, how coherent structure is maintained, and how locally describable physics
                arises from the underlying process. Like rotations or evolution equations in standard physics, they
                summarize transformation—what changes, what persists, and what becomes accessible. Framed this way, they
                demystify the world by replacing “hidden causes” with explicit, checkable structure, and they provide a
                clean bridge from the substrate to the effective laws we recognize as physics.

        <div class="bento-card">
            <span class="tag">CLOSED LOOP</span>
            <h3>SELF-REFERENTIAL IDENTITY</h3>
            <p>
                Self-referential identity is the closure condition under which the substrate remains consistent
                (invariant) under its own generative dynamics. In practical terms, reality is modeled as a
                self-mapping process: the rules that generate physical descriptions are the same rules that determine
                which descriptions remain coherent. What appear as “local laws” are contextual expressions of a single
                global generative rule (denoted <span class="math">\(H_{\mathrm{tot}}\)</span> in the formalism), not
                separate disconnected mechanisms. This makes persistence something the system earns through
                self-maintenance:
                structures endure only insofar as they stay compatible with the dynamics that continually updates the
                substrate. Framed this way, self-reference demystifies the world with an explicit, checkable statement
                of
                internal closure.

            <h3>GLOBAL COHERENCE</h3>
            <p>
                \(H_{tot}\) is the global generator of substrate evolution: a compact mathematical rule that organizes
                the dynamics of the entire informational substrate before any local description, measurement, or
                emergent “world” is defined. It enforces global coherence by constraining which configurations and
                transformations can remain mutually compatible within one self-consistent whole. In this sense,
                \(H_{tot}\) is not an external agent acting on reality, but the intrinsic coherence law through which
                the substrate stabilizes persistent structure and yields reliable, shared physical regularities.

                The coherence/projection map that yields a locally usable representation of the underlying substrate.
                It selects stable, contextual structure—turning “total reality” into an accessible description that can
                function as consistent physics from within.

                The effective operator that organizes what is accessible into a coherent world-model. In this layer,

            The next substrate state is obtained by applying the same global update rule to the current substrate state;
            one update is one complete application of this rule, and what persists is what remains stable under repeated
            updates.
